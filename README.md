# trapezoidal-method
This is a program written in Python to solve first order ordinary differential equations using the Trapezoidal method.

In the given code, the following initial value problem is solved for illustration-

* y' = t * y; y(0) = 1; 0 <= t <= 3
* Step size = 0.01, Number of guesses per time node = 50
